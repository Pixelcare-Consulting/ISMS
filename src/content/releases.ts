/**
 * Release history for in-app "What's New" and update logs.
 *
 * Maintenance (each release):
 * 1. Bump `version` in package.json AND README "Current version" to match the newest entry
 * 2. Prepend a new entry below (newest first) with matching version, date, title, highlights,
 *    and typed changes (feature | improvement | fix)
 * 3. Set `releasedAt` (ISO datetime, Asia/Manila +08:00) on the latest entry for ship clock time
 * 4. Deploy — login footer and What's new dialog update automatically
 *
 * Semver / when to bump (do NOT dump unrelated work into one mega note):
 * - patch (x.y.Z): fixes, polish, small UX tweaks (confirm dialogs, NEW badge placement,
 *   sticky header removal, timestamp display, copy/layout polish)
 * - minor (x.Y.0): new core modules or capabilities (e.g. Service center ops, sales status
 *   staying with the sale line, Official Sales accounting columns & bulk delete, Order Policy
 *   daily lock). Each distinct core module/capability gets its OWN version — never mash
 *   unrelated core features into one entry
 * - major (X.0.0): breaking product changes (rare)
 *
 * Same-day consolidation:
 * - ONLY consolidate when changes share the same patch theme (related polish/fixes)
 * - NEVER consolidate a new core module/capability into an existing patch or into another
 *   unrelated core feature — bump a new minor (or major) instead
 *
 * Writing style (always — end users, not developers):
 * - Describe what people can do or what feels better
 * - No file names, SQL, FK, schema fields, migration names, reseed steps, or RBAC jargon dumps
 * - Avoid technical jargon (hydration, pool timeout, GROUP BY, slugs, etc.)
 * - Keep highlights short; order changes as feature → improvement → fix
